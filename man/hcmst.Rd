\description{
This dataset is derived from the 2022 wave of the longitudinal HCMST study, conducted by researchers at Stanford University.
The study explores how romantic relationships are formed and sustained in the United States, with a focus on relationship quality,
social context, and the effects of major external events like the COVID-19 pandemic.
}
\details{
The dataset includes demographic characteristics, relationship context, couple behavior, and pandemic-related experiences,
making it well-suited for studies on interpersonal dynamics, inequality, and resilience in romantic partnerships.
